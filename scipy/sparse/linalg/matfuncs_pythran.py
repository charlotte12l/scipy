    The strategy of falling back to a sixth order Taylor expansion
    was suggested by the Spallation Neutron Source docs
    which was found on the internet by google search.
    http://www.ornl.gov/~t6p/resources/xal/javadoc/gov/sns/tools/math/ElementaryFunction.html
    The details of the cutoff point and the Horner-like evaluation
    was picked without reference to anything in particular.

    Note that sinch is not currently implemented in scipy.special,
    whereas the "engineer's" definition of sinc is implemented.
    The implementation of sinc involves a scaling factor of pi
    that distinguishes it from the "mathematician's" version of sinc.

    The argument X is modified in-place, but this modification is not the same
    as the returned value of the function.
    This function also takes pains to do things in ways that are compatible
    with sparse matrices, for example by avoiding fancy indexing
    and by using methods of the matrices whenever possible instead of
    using functions of the numpy or scipy libraries themselves.
